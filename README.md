# ☣️SCP-069 ☣️


### ❓What does it do?❓ 
SCP-069 is a new class of playable SCP, this for the player's camera will be like a 049 at first, but when it kills its first victim, it will take its shape, its size and steal whatever object the victim had in hand, thus replicating almost perfectly to his victim.
This replication process will do it every time it kills, which opens up new and interesting scenarios with this scp.
